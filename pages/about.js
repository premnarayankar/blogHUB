        A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is a discussion or informational
        website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often
        informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed
        in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears
        first, at the top of the web page.

        A blog service is a website that lets you create and maintain a blog. It
        hosts your blog, which means it gives your blog its own web address, or
        URL. Your blog service also stores your blog's data. Each blog service
        has different features, but they all let you share your opinions,
        interests, photos, and more.
